    "## Analysis of performance of city school based Math and Reading scores\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we analyse the performance data for 15 schools (both charter and district) with varied student sizes. Math Score and Reading score are considered to be the key performance factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare performance, we find out averages of math and reading scores, % passing in math and reading and % overall passing rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we find the relationsips between, % overall passing rate and school size, school type and per student budget\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis indicates that\n",
    "\n",
    "- Charter schools have significantly out-performed district school across both math and reading. \n",
    "- School funding or per student budget seems to have an inverse relationshiop with performance. Schools with higer spending have under-performed than schools with lower funding.\n",
    "- Interestingly, most of the Charter schools per student budget are less than USD 615 where as all district schools have funding greater than USD 615. This means, there are other reason like school policies, teaching methods that could be underlying reasons for better or worse performance. \n",
    "- Small (< 1000 students) and mid-size schools (1000-2000 students) have significantly performed better than large size schools( > 2000 students) especially in Math\n"
